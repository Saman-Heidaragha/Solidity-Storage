# Solidity-Storage

In this project, I explored how data storage works in Solidity, the language used for writing Ethereum smart contracts. The focus was to understand how different types of variables are stored and how to design contracts more efficiently.

## What’s Inside:
The project dives into key aspects of Solidity’s storage system, including:

- State Variables: These are stored on-chain and persist throughout the contract’s life.
- Memory Variables: Temporary data that only exists while a function is running.
- Stack Usage: Small, short-term values managed directly by the EVM.
- 
## Why This Matters:
Understanding how Solidity handles storage is essential for writing smart contracts that are both cost-effective and efficient. This project helped me break down the differences between storage, memory, and stack, and I included examples to show how each works in practice.

## Why It’s Useful:

This project is a helpful resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Solidity’s storage model. It’s particularly useful for developers aiming to write more efficient and cost-effective smart contracts.

By studying this project, you’ll gain a clearer picture of how Solidity manages data behind the scenes and how to leverage this knowledge to build better blockchain applications.
